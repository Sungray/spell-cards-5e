# [DnD Spell Cards](https://dndspellcards.com/)

This is a little web app that makes it easy to generate printable PDFs of your dungeons and dragons spells! Those printable PDFs can easily be cut up and treated like cards. I like to keep mine in a binder, so, that's why I wanted this.

Many thanks to [DnD5eAPI](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/), [Game Icons](https://game-icons.net/), and the [SRD](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf).
